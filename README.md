It includes tips for helping the player move to the next level and introduces innovative mechanics not usually seen on games of this caliber such as trampoline, shoot tube, Simon color game, and memory card game. All assets and ideas portrayed in this game are my own, no outside sources were used.</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

</p>

<p>This is what you see  when the game starts. In the top right corner, you have the timer. The timer starts are 4000, and goes down as times goes on. On the top left corner, you have your score. The number on the left of the "/" is how many points you have, and on the right the number of points available. In order to win the game, you must hit all targets but shooting them with your gun.</p>

<h3>Losing</h3>

</p>

<p>If you fail to hit all the targets in time, this window will pop up., indicating you lost. Here you have two options: you can try again by pressing "Restart" and go to the start of the game, or you can press "Quit" to close the application.</p>

<p>If you are able to hit all the targets in time, you will see this screen, indicating you won! From here you can play the game again to see if you can do it faster, or press "Quit" to close the application.</p>


<h3>Pausing</h3>

</p>

<p>Another mechanic I added to the game is the ability to pause the game by pressing the "escape" key. This is really useful because it provides the player with the option to "restart", "quit", or "resume" the game without having to wait for the timer to go off.</p>

<h3>Particles</h3>

</p>

<p>A very nice part of the game is how the target gets destroyed. The way that is done is by using the particles tool in Unreal Engine and applying to the target mesh.</p>
